The **Bank Application** is a Java-based system designed to manage 
essential banking operations efficiently. It consists of five core
files: **BankAccount.java**, which models account details and transactions;
**Customer.java**, which represents customer information and linked accounts; 
**BankService.java**, which implements business logic for creating accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers; 
**Transaction.java**, which logs transaction details such as type, amount, and timestamp; and 
**BankApplication.java**, 
the main entry point that facilitates user interaction via a command-line interface.
This modular structure ensures scalability, security, and ease of maintenance.

How It Works:
User logs in or creates an account.
They can view their balance, deposit/withdraw money, or transfer funds.
The system updates the BankAccount and logs the transaction.
Users can check their transaction history.
The application ensures data security and error handling.
